#Fridge watchdog as a school project.

This was our team project for embedded systems. We did this in a group of 4 students, using Raspberry pi 4 and Nucleo F303RE with some sensors and resistors.
Goal was to create IOT device with Raspberry and Linux environment and pythons flask framework was our solution for the web page.
See the poster for more information.
This repo is still missing the code for nucleo, ill update as soon as possible.
